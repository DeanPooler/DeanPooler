Hello, I'm Dean Pooler, an aspiring developer, and a student.

I'm currently in school following a general IT program. However programming isn't covered much here, but this is where my passion lies.
So for about a year I've been teaching myself how to code in my free time. I have tried to learn some coding when I was younger, but most of what I learned, other than basic concepts, didn't stick.


I'm currently learning through [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) and just trying some things on my own.
I'm following a course on Fullstack Javascript using Node and aa bit of Ruby on Rails.
In the past I worked through the book "Head First: Java", which got me familiar with coding in general.

*WIP*
